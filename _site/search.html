In fact, individual (scalar) values (variables) are vectors of length one. An R vector is a single set of values in a particular order of the same type. We can concatenate values into a vector with c(): ages&lt;-c(18,19,18,23) Comparable Python objects include Panda Series and single dimensional numpy array. While Python arrays start at 0, R arrays start at index position 1. ages&lt;-c(18,19,18,23) ages ages[1] ages[2:4]...",
