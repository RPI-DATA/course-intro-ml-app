        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will see how to use [TPOT](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/api/), a Python library developed for automatic machine learning feature preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Using [genetic programming](http://geneticprogramming.com/tutorial/), TPOT tries to find the best machine learning pipeline for a dataset by evaluating thousands of possibilites. \n",
        "\n",
        "The machine learning pipeline in this context consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Feature Preprocessing\n",
        "  * Imputing missing values and scaling values\n",
        "  * Constructing new features such as polynomial transformations\n",
        "2. Feature selection\n",
        "  * Dimensionality reduction, for example using PCA and other techniques\n",
        "3. Model Selection\n",
        "  * Evaluting a number of machine learning models\n",
        "4. Hyperparameter tuning\n",
        "  * Finding the optimal settings of the model for the particular problem\n",
        "\n",
        "TPOT is one of a class of methods known as [auto-ml (short for automated machine learning)](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/01/current-state-automated-machine-learning.html) which aim to simplify the work of the data scientist by automatically finding the optimal (or near-optimal) feature preprocessing steps and model for the problem. Machine learning is  typically a very time-consuming and knowledge-intensive part of a data science problem. Auto-ml is not designed to replace the data scientist, but rather free her to work on more important aspects of the complete problem, such as acquiring data and interpreting the model results. In effect, TPOT, and auto-ml in general, will in effect be a \"data science assistant\" that will be another tool among many used by data scientists. Machine learning is only one part of the data science process, and it still takes a human to weave the different aspects of a problem together into a complete working product.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other entries in the field of auto - ml include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* [Auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/)\n",
        "* [H20](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/welcome.html)\n",
        "* [Google Cloud AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/)\n",

        "We saw how to use TPOT, an auto-ml Python library for automatically designing a machine learning pipeline. This tool will evaluate thousands of feature construction, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning configurations in order to simplify the job of the data scientist. As machine learning is just one part of the data science workflow, auto-ml will not replace the data scientist, but allow her to spend time on more important aspects of the process. Automated machine learning is still in its early stages, but it appears to be a promising method for optimizing the often tedious and frustrating task of finding the best machine learning pipeline. \n",
        "\n",
        "While being an early adopter does not always pay off, in this case, TPOT is mature enough to have a simple-to-use interface, but also new enough that you will be ahead of the curve if you are familiar with its use. With that in mind, find a problem and get out there are try to solve it! If you are looking for a place to start, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (The Self-Proclaimed Home of Data Science) has many datasets and problems that are well-suited for application of auto-ml. "
